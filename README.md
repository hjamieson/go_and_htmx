# Go and HTMX Learning Project

This repo contains the test projects I write as I tried to learn Go & HTMX.  Don't look here for sage advice; I am a total noob at both of these languages.  I have made some progress with the intro hx- attributes.  I've also explored `hx-boost`ed links and a few other fields.

 Server1| just has a simple go server that redirects static and the root to a simple page.  Nothing to see here.
 Server2| is the complete contacts app with NO HTMX.  This is the starting point for introduction of HTMX thingies.
 htmx1  |is the introduction of HTMX attributes on links & forms.
 htmx2  |explores the hx-boost attribute.  It takes some getting used to, as it replaces the entire contents of the BODY tag.
 contacts2| integrates some HTMX patterns into the Contacts app.
